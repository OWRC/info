A number of rainfall-runoff models that can be applied for long-term hydrological modelling. They are "lumped" meaning that there is no consideration for processes occurring within a watershed, only it's only application is taking a climate dataset to simulate a streamflow hydrograph.

The models selected specifically because they have the ability to account for groundwater recharge rates and they include:

* The Atkinson simple storage model (Atkinson et.al., 2002, 2003; Wittenberg and Sivapalan, 1999)
* The Dawdy and O'Donnell (1965) model
* The GR4J model (Perrin et.al., 2003)
* The HBV model (Bergström, 1976, 1992; Seibert and McDonnell, 2010)
* The HMETS model (Martel et.al., 2017)
* The Manabe (1969) simple storage model with an added linear groundwater reservoir
* The multilayer capacitance model (Struthers et.al., 2003)
* The Quinn simple storage model (Quinn and Beven, 1993)
* The SIXPAR/TWOPAR model (Gupta and Sorooshian, 1983; Duan et.al., 1992)
* The simple parallel linear reservoir model (Buytaert and Beven, 2011)

Below is a brief description of the model design.

# Lumped Models


## Atkinson simple storage model

## Dawdy and O'Donnell

The Dawdy and O'Donnell (1965) model is the classic bucket type model.

## GR4J

GR4J is a simple (i.e., parsimonious) 4-parameter model.

## HBV

The model is commonly applied in a semi-distributed manner, however it can be applied in a lumped fashion.

## HMETS

The Hydrological Model of École de Technologie Supérieure (HMETS) is a straightforward, yet highly efficient conceptual hydrological model built for Canadian climates. It simulates all key hydrological processes, including snow accumulation and snowmelt. Is is simple in terms of its parameterization yet preserves common conceptual water stores used in hydrological models.

## Manabe

The Manabe model is simple storage model with an added linear groundwater reservoir. This is most commonly known as the "bucket" model. Manabe used this to represent land surface processes of a global circulation model.

For instance, the Dawdy and O'Donnell model (above) uses 3 Manabe-type bucket models to represent catchment hydrology.

To represent groundwater, a simple linear-decay groundwater model is added to simulate baseflow discharge.

This is the simplest of all models.


## The Multilayer Capacitance Model

A three layer model built to model Lysimeter water balances. Here a simple linear baseflow model is added to handle drainage from the bottom layer.


## Quinn

The Quinn model is the original land surface model used with TOPMODEL. When the Quinn model is used in isolation, a simple linear baseflow model is added to handle drainage.

Where the Quinn model differs is that it ca account for a shallow water table.

*A simple version of the vertical storage element in the Quinn model. $S_i$ is the local gravity drainage storage deficit, $q_v$ is local recharge to the saturated zone and $\psi_o$ is the depth of the "capillary fringe" (Beven etal., 1995).*

$$
    s_i = (\theta_s-\theta_\text{fc})(z_i-\psi_o)=\Delta\theta_1(z_i-\psi_o)
$$


## SIXPAR

The SIXPAR model is a 6-parameter model that utilizes 2 manabe buckets. This is a simpler construction of the Dawdy and O'Donnell above. SIXPAR can be further simplified to a single manabe bucket named TWOPAR. This model does not make explicit use of potential evaporation, the input is net precipitation $(P-E_p)$.

## SPLR

The simple parallel linear reservoir (SPLR) model with 3 storage reservoirs needs only 3 parameters. Like SIXPAR, this model does not make explicit use of potential evaporation, the input is net precipitation.

## Tank

The tank model is a conceptual model taking a set of Manabe reservoirs ordered in a particular way to represent separate stores and their affect on runoff generation (Sugawara, 1995).
